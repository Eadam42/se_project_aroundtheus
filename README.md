**Description**

This project is the first time I ever implemented media queries so the transitions are a bit rough. It is a basic responsive page detailing different locations across the U.S.For this project I used grid and flexbox for responive design. I started the basic layout at 1220px, then made media queries for 2 different resolutions( a medium size resolution at 872px and small size resolution at 320px ).
